Instructions

Soak red whole chili in 1/2 cup water for 15 mins. Grind chili, ginger and garlic along with the water to a paste.
Start instant pot in sauté mode and heat 2 tbsp butter in it. Add onions and sauté for 3 minutes.
Add bell pepper and sauté for another 2 minutes.

When the instant pot beeps, release the pressure naturally. Open and use an immersion blender to coarsely grind the ingredients.
Change to sauté mode and let the bhaji boil for a minute. Mix in the lemon juice.
Bhaji is ready to be served. Garnish with cilantro and chopped onions.
Preparing Pav
Slice each pav or dinner rolls in two halves.
Heat butter on a pan and place the sliced pav on it. Lightly toast on one side and then turn to toast on the other side.
Pav are ready to be served with bhaji.
Recipe Notes
The real Mumbai pav bhaji is always made with butter.  However you can prepare it will oil too.
I recommend using Kashmiri chili, as that enhances the color of the bhaji.  If you don't have it, use another whole chili or red chili/cayenne powder.
Vary with your choice of vegetables.
